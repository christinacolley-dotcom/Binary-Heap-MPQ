# Binary-Heap-MPQ
The objective of this experiment is to test the efficiency of three implementations of a priority queue. Three different data structures are used in this assignment, a linked list, binary heap and vector. For the sorted MPQ class, a linked list was used to implement the minimum priority queue functions. For the unsorted MPQ class a vector was used to implement the queue and all of itâ€™s functions as well. The functions provided in the MPQ template were removeMin(), isEmpty(), insert(), and min(). The assignment also required a binary heap class to be implemented for an MPQ implementation. After these three implementations, the main file is provided to test the efficiency of the code.
